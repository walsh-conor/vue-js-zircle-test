# vue-js-zircle-test
Vue.js Zircle test training site

This site was created using Vue.js and the Zircle library.
It is a 'Prezi' like site, where the screen zooms in to get to the next section.
It was created as a test to learn about the library and to see if it could be used for a bigger project.
